	abstract = {Resumo Em vista do elevado grau tecnológico da atualidade, precisa-se continuamente discutir e revisar a temática da ética no ambiente acadêmico. As ferramentas tecnológicas não recriaram o padrão ético, mas passaram a oferecer alternativas aos alunos, facilitando práticas como “cola”, plágio e falsificações, o que tornou ainda mais complexo o desafio da instituição de ensino. Este artigo aponta os prejuízos que a desonestidade acadêmica pode representar para a sociedade, na medida em que refletem no padrão ético dos futuros profissionais. Buscou-se caracterizar os principais tipos de desonestidade acadêmica, indicar exemplos de como algumas práticas são toleradas de forma aberta e de como algumas escolas médicas trabalham o tema em suas matrizes curriculares, comparar como outras culturas tratam essa questão, e, por fim, apresentam-se algumas recomendações gerais acerca de mudanças que possam contribuir para a melhoria do padrão ético e moral nas relações acadêmicas.

            Resumen Dado el alto nivel actual de la tecnología, es necesario discutir y revisar constantemente el tema de la ética en el ámbito académico. Las herramientas tecnológicas no reformularon el estándar ético, pero ofrecen alternativas a los estudiantes, y facilitan prácticas como hacer trampa, plagio y falsificaciones, lo cual tornó el desafío de la intuición de enseñanza aún más complejo. Este artículo cientifíco analiza los daños que la deshonestidad académica puede representar a la sociedad, en la medida en que repercuten en el estándar ético de los futuros profesionales. Se procuró caracterizar los principales tipos de deshonestidad académica, presentar ejemplos de cómo se han tolerado abiertamente algunas de estas prácticas y cómo algunas facultades médicas abordan el tema en sus matrices curriculares; comparar cómo se trata el tema en otras culturas y, finalmente, se presentan algunas recomendaciones generales sobre los cambios que pueden contribuir a la mejora de las normas éticas y morales en las relaciones académicas.

            Abstract Given the current high level of technology, it is necessary to continually discuss and review the topic of ethics in the academic environment. Technological tools did not recreate the ethical standard, but began to offer students alternatives, facilitating practices such as cheating, plagiarism, and falsification, which have made the challenges for educational institutions even more complex. This article shows the damage and losses that academic dishonesty may pose to society, as it reflects on the ethical standards of future professionals. The authors sought to characterize the main types of academic dishonesty, present examples of how some unethical practices have been openly tolerated and how some medical schools approach this subject in their curriculum matrices, compare how the issue is dealt with in other cultures, and finally, present some general recommendations on changes that can contribute to improving the ethical and moral standards in academic relations.},

A partir daí, fundamenta a análise conceitual da responsabilidade civil e das teorias da culpa e do risco. Finalmente, analisa as mudanças nesta relação introduzidas pelas NTICs e as interpretações a ela dadas pelo Marco Civil da Internet, em vigor desde 2014.

Investiga cómo estas asociaciones pueden o no pueden ser declaradas responsables de los textos plagiados que se le presenten y, en consecuencia publicados en sus sitios web. Propone un análisis que relaciona el fenómeno de los cambios sociales provocados por las Tecnologías de Información y Comunicación – TICs, especialmente internet, con la legislación vigente para la protección de los derechos de autor. A partir de ahí, subyace el análisis conceptual de la responsabilidad y las teorías de la culpa y el riesgo. Por último, se analizan los cambios en esta relación introducida por las TIC y las interpretaciones dadas a él por el Marco Civil de Internet, en vigor desde 2014.

            Abstract This article has as object the analysis of liability of scientific associations in relation to plagiarism committed by third parties. It investigates how these associations may or may not be held liable for plagiarized texts submitted to them and consequently published on their websites. This work proposes an analysis that relates the phenomenon of social changes brought about by Information and Communication Technologies – ICTs, especially the internet, with the current legislation for the protection of authors’ rights. From there, this paper underlies the conceptual analysis of liability and theories of guilt and risk. Finally, we analyze the changes in this relationship introduced by ICTs and the interpretations given to it by the Civil Marco Internet, in force since 2014. In conclusion this article points out that such associations – treated as Internet content portals – can objectively be held responsible in case of plagiarism, when notified court do not withdraw their websites the plagiarized text.},

An additional issue typical of industries that work under the copyright regime is that the oligopoly market structure of the publishing industry which in turn further contributes to increase their products’ prices.

The theoretical framework is composed by the theories of living lawfully and the struggle for recognition. A qualitative analysis is achieved through the methodology of the rules of inference. The main results are that intellectual property laws ends up encouraging market monopoly rather than competitive innovation and that the software piracy helps rather than hinders the major software corporations, because it hampers the new computer software developers from entering this market. Therefore, from a legal perspective, restoring the role of the software intellectual property law may enable a better legal protection as well as help disseminate access to knowledge, as far as technological innovation in this market is concerned.},

Nesta comunicação, exploram-se as controvérsias ligadas ao compartilhamento não consentido de obras científicas protegidas por direitos autorais. O objetivo deste texto é demonstrar a existência desse debate público, indicando as disputas por espaço e as narrativas correspondentes.

However, this phenomenon also generates tensions even with the Open Access Movement, that traditionally advocates that the barriers to open access be overturned exclusively by legal mechanisms. In this paper, the controversies related to the unconsented sharing of scientific studies protected by copyrights are explored. The aim of this discussion is to demonstrate the existence of this public debate, showing the several quarrels for space and the related narratives. The crisis generated in the Open Access Movement by the recent development of illegal initiatives that managed to promote free access to almost all scientific literature is here considered.},

O escopo teórico do estudo versa sobre ética, competitividade e "jeitinho brasileiro", assim como o emprego de práticas acadêmicas fraudulentas no Brasil e no mundo. Foi realizado um levantamento por meio de questionário com 164 estudantes de pós-graduação lato sensu e 179 estudantes de graduação. O questionário abordou a opinião dos respondentes diante de diversas situações envolvendo fraudes acadêmicas, incluindo o questionamento se os alunos já haviam participado pessoalmente de alguma dessas situações, assim como seus amigos e conhecidos. O questionário também explorou as intenções comportamentais dos respondentes em fraudar diante de quatro cenários acadêmicos diferentes, considerando seu relacionamento com terceiros, se amigos ou não. Além disso, os respondentes apresentaram seu grau de concordância em relação a diversas crenças relacionadas à fraude de atividades escolares. Na análise, foram utilizadas técnicas estatísticas univariadas e bivariadas, como teste t e correlações. Os resultados mostram que mais de 70\% dos alunos de ambos os cursos já se envolveram em situações fraudulentas na sala de aula e mais de 90\% deles acreditam que outros alunos já participaram de fraudes acadêmicas. Suas intenções de fraudar são maiores quando os amigos estão envolvidos. Os estudantes de graduação tendem a minimizar a gravidade de atos escolares fraudulentos. O artigo sugere ações para as instituições de ensino na acepção de não apenas reduzir o uso de cola e o plágio, mas também promover a integridade que deve nortear as ações acadêmicas e profissionais. Entender o comportamento acadêmico ante as práticas desonestas pode ajudar a prever e prevenir procedimentos desonestos quando do exercício da profissão.

Este estudio tiene como objetivo analizar el comportamiento de los estudiantes en los cursos de Administración de Empresas cuando se trata de prácticas académicas deshonestas, como el plagio; siendo la base teórica para el desarrollo de la investigación el trabajo de Chapman, Davis, Toy e Wright (2004). La discusión teórica se ocupa de ética, competitividad y el jeitinho brasileño, así como del uso de prácticas académicas fraudulentas en Brasil y en el mundo. Fue realizada una encuesta mediante un cuestionario con 164 estudiantes de postgrado y de 179 estudiantes de graduación. El cuestionario preguntó las opiniones de los encuestados en relación a varias situaciones que involucran fraude académico, incluyendo una pregunta sobre si los estudiantes habían participado personalmente en algunas de esas situaciones, así como sus amigos y conocidos. El cuestionario también exploró las intenciones de los encuestados frente a cuatro escenarios académicos, teniendo en cuenta la relación de ellos con otros alumnos, amigos o no. Además, los encuestados mostraron su grado de acuerdo con diversas creencias relacionadas con la práctica deshonesta de actividades escolares. En el análisis, se utilizaron técnicas estadísticas univariadas y bivariadas, como el test t y correlaciones. Los resultados muestran que más del 70\% de los alumnos de ambos cursos estuvieron implicados en situaciones fraudulentas en clase y que más del 90\% creen que otros estudiantes participan en fraude académico. Su intención de cometer fraude es mayor cuando se trata de amigos. Estudiantes de graduación tienden a minimizar la gravedad de actos fraudulentos en la escuela. El artículo sugiere acciones en el sentido de no sólo reducir el plagio, sino también promover la integridad que debe guiar las conductas académicas y profesionales.

            Fraudulent activities in the corporate world have been a growing societal concern and may be associated with failures in the educational system. The objective of this study is to analyze the behavior of Business students when it comes to dishonest academic practices such as cheating and plagiarism; the theoretical basis for the development of this research is the work of Chapman, Davis, Toy e Wright (2004). In terms of theoretical scope, this study discusses ethics, competitiveness and the Brazilian jeitinho, as well as the use of fraudulent academic practices in Brazil and worldwide. A survey was implemented and a questionnaire was answered by 164 graduate students and 179 undergraduates. The questionnaire asked about views on several situations involving academic fraud, including a question whether students, as well as their friends and acquaintances, had participated personally in any of these practices. The questionnaire also explored respondents' behavioral intentions in the face of four different fraudulent academic scenarios, in the light of their relationships with others, whether friends or otherwise. In addition, respondents indicated their level of agreement with beliefs related to dishonest academic activities. In the analysis, univariate and bivariate statistical techniques, such as the t test and correlations, were used. The results show that over 70\% of students in both courses have been involved in fraudulent situations in the classroom and more than 90\% of them believe that other students have participated in academic fraud. The disposition to cheat is greater when friends are also involved. Graduate students tend to minimize the seriousness of fraudulent acts in universities. This article suggests that educational institutions should act to reduce cheating and plagiarism, but also to promote the integrity that should guide academic and professional conduct. Understanding academic behavior in the face of dishonest practices can help to predict and prevent dishonest behavior in the corporative world.},

Nonis and Swift (1998) indicated that 63\% of the stu-dents they surveyed said they had cheated during college.
McCabe (1992) found that asmany as 87\% of business students admitted cheating duringcollege.
METHODS TRADITIONALLY USED
The most popular approach forestimating dishonest behavior involves generic measures ofcheating (asking students whether they have knowinglycheated during a certain period of time—for example, “Haveyou cheated in the past year?”). These self-reported measureshave been criticized for several reasons. A number of authorshave suggested that students may systematically overreportcheating because of peer pressure, faculty expectations, ortheir confusion about what cheating is (David and Kovach1979; Houston 1986; Karlins et al. 1988; Nelson andSchaeffer 1986).
Other authors, however, provide evidencethat students seem to underreport dishonest behaviors basedon self-reported measures (Allen et al. 1998).
Another approach to the measurement of cheatinginvolves asking students if they have been dishonest in a spe-cific situation—for example, “Have you shared your answerson a test with another student?” (Allen et al. 1998; Maramarkand Maline 1993; McCabe and Trevino 1993, 1996; Nonisand Swift 1998).
Studies such as Allen et al. (1998) havefound large differences in self-reported likelihoods of cheat-ing based on situational factors, demonstrating that situation-specific measures may more accurately reflect cheating incli-nations than global measures of cheating. Situation-specificmeasures, however, like the generic measures, could also becompromised by under- or overreporting, particularly if thesituation described does not exactly conform to the student’sexperience.
QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT
A questionnaire was developed to assess students’cheating-related beliefs and propensities and their academicdishonesty attributions to others. In addition, the survey in-cluded measures aimed at understanding the influence ofpeers within specific cheating situations. The wording ofquestions and specific measures was based both on the resultsof the aforementioned exploratory research and on the mea-sures used by Allen et al. (1998) and Nonis and Swift (1998).The questionnaire was pretested using a marketing researchclass. The questionnaire contained four parts. The first sec-tion asked about students’ beliefs and their behavior regard-ing seven cheating situations (see Table 1 for details). Thesecond part of the questionnaire involved four cheating sce-narios in which students were asked what they would do ifthey were in the situations described in the scenarios (seeTable 2 for details). A third section asked students to rate aseries of belief statements using a strongly disagree/stronglyagree scale. These belief statements are a subset of those usedby Allen et al. (1998) and address issues such as Stricter mon-itoring of exams would reduce cheating and Cheating deval-ues the business degree. The full set of belief statements canbe seen in Table 3. The final section consisted of demographicinformation about the students, including questions aboutage, major, gender, work status, GPA, and semester standing.These individual difference variables were included because
past research on academic dishonesty has found that theymay affect behaviors and attitudes regarding cheating.},

	abstract = {Despite the growth of Open Access, potentially illegally circumventing paywalls to access scholarly publications is becoming a more mainstream phenomenon. The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of  {\textasciitilde}28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35\% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11\% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45\% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80\% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons, and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.},

	abstract = {Background
              In depression, non-remission, recurrence of depressive episodes after remission and conversion to bipolar disorder are crucial determinants of poor outcome. The present study aimed to determine the cumulative incidences and clinical predictors of these long-term outcomes after the first lifetime episode of depression.
            
            
              Method
              A total of 301 in- or out-patients aged 18–70 years with a validated diagnosis of a single depressive episode were assessed from 2005 to 2007. At 5 years of follow-up, 262 patients were reassessed by means of the life chart method and diagnostic interviews from 2011 to 2013. Cumulative incidences and the influence of clinical variables on the rates of remission, recurrence and conversion to bipolar disorder, respectively, were estimated by survival analysis techniques.
            
            
              Results
              Within 5 years, 83.3\% obtained remission, 31.5\% experienced recurrence of depression and 8.6\% converted to bipolar disorder (6.3\% within the first 2 years). Non-remission increased with younger age, co-morbid anxiety and suicidal ideations. Recurrence increased with severity and treatment resistance of the first depression, and conversion to bipolar disorder with treatment resistance, a family history of affective disorder and co-morbid alcohol or drug abuse.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The identified clinical characteristics of the first lifetime episode of depression should guide patients and clinicians for long-term individualized tailored treatment.},

The classification of the different subtypes of bipolar disorders is done depending on the severity and frequency of the episodes. Other subtypes beside bipolar I and bipolar II disorder are rapid cycling (more than 4 episodes of mania, depression, hypomania or mixed state in one year) and cyclothymia (hypomanic and subdepressive symptoms over a two year period). Besides a thorough psychiatric and neurological examination, further clinical tests should be performed in order to exclude differential diagnosis (psychiatric as well as neurological and somatic diseases). 
The course of the illness is often negatively affected by the high frequency of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. After all the prognosis of bipolar disorder is depending on the individual course of the illness. Notably comorbidities and psychotic symptoms seem to have a negative influence on the prognosis.},

	abstract = {Background
              Some personality characteristics have previously been associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorder. Longitudinal studies are required in order to tease apart temporary (state) and enduring (trait) differences in personality among individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). This study aimed to determine whether there is a characteristic personality profile in BD, and whether associations between BD and personality are best explained by state or trait effects.
            
            
              Method
              A total of 2247 participants in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder study completed the NEO Five-Factor Inventory administered at study entry, and at 1 and 2 years.
            
            
              Results
              Personality in BD was characterized by high neuroticism (N) and openness (O), and low agreeableness (A), conscientiousness (C) and extraversion (E). This profile was replicated in two independent samples, and openness was found to distinguish BD from major depressive disorder. Latent growth modeling demonstrated that manic symptoms were associated with increased E and decreased A, and depressed symptoms with higher N and lower E, A, C and O. During euthymic phases, high N and low E scores predicted a future depression-prone course.
            
            
              Conclusions
              While there are clear state effects of mood on self-reported personality, personality variables during euthymia predict future course of illness. Personality disturbances in extraversion, neuroticism and openness may be enduring characteristics of patients with BD.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Introduction: In Brazil, there is no valid instrument to measure subjective cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. The present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA) in Brazilian bipolar patients. We further investigated the relationship between the COBRA, objective cognitive measures, and illness course variables.  Methods: The total sample (N=150) included 85 bipolar disorder patients and 65 healthy controls. The psychometric properties of the COBRA (e.g., internal consistency, concurrent validity, discriminative validity, factor analyses, ROC curve, and feasibility) were analyzed.  Results: The COBRA showed a one-factor structure with very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.890). Concurrent validity was indicated by a strong correlation with the cognitive domain of the FAST (r=0.811, p{\textless}0.001). Bipolar patients experienced greater cognitive complaints (mean=14.69; standard deviation [SD]=10.03) than healthy controls (mean=6.78; SD=5.49; p{\textless}0.001), suggesting discriminative validity of the instrument. No significant correlations were found between the COBRA and objective cognitive measures. Furthermore, higher COBRA scores were associated with residual depressive (r=0.448; p{\textless}0.001) and manic (r=0.376; p{\textless}0.001) symptoms, number of depressive episodes (r=0.306; p=0.011), number of total episodes (r=0.256; p=0.038), and suicide attempts (r=0.356; p=0.003).  Conclusion: The COBRA is a valid instrument to assess cognitive complaints, and the combined use of subjective-objective cognitive measures enables the correct identification of cognitive dysfunctions in bipolar disorder.

            Resumo  Introdução: No Brasil, não existem instrumentos válidos para medir a disfunção cognitiva subjetiva no transtorno bipolar. O presente estudo analisou as propriedades psicométricas da Escala de Disfunções Cognitivas no Transtorno Bipolar (COBRA) em uma amostra brasileira de pacientes bipolares. Adicionalmente, investigamos a relação entre a COBRA, medidas cognitivas objetivas e curso da doença.  Métodos: A amostra total (n=150) incluiu 85 pacientes com transtorno bipolar e 65 controles saudáveis. As propriedades psicométricas da COBRA (consistência interna, validade concorrente, validade discriminativa, análise fatorial, curva ROC e fidedignidade) foram analisadas.  Resultados: A COBRA apresentou estrutura de um fator com alta consistência interna (alfa de Cronbach=0,890). A validade concorrente ficou demonstrada pela forte correlação com o domínio cognitivo da FAST (r=0,811, p{\textless}0,001). Pacientes bipolares tiveram mais queixas cognitivas [média=14,69; desvio padrão (DP)=10,03] que os controles (média=6,78; DP=5,49; p{\textless}0,001), sugerindo a validade discriminativa do instrumento. Não houve correlação significativa entre a COBRA e medidas cognitivas objetivas. Além disso, escores mais altos na COBRA estiveram associados com sintomas residuais depressivos (r=0,448; p{\textless}0,001) e maníacos (r=0,376; p{\textless}0,001), número de episódios depressivos (r=0,306; p=0,011), número de episódios totais (r=0.256; p=0.038) e tentativas de suicídio (r=0,356; p=0,003).  Conclusão: A COBRA é um instrumento válido para avaliar queixas cognitivas, e o uso combinado das medidas cognitivas subjetivas-objetivas possibilita a correta identificação das disfunções cognitivas no transtorno bipolar.},

	abstract = {Objetivos: O MINI é uma entrevista diagnóstica padronizada breve (15-30 minutos), compatível com os critérios do DSM-III-R/IV e da CID-10, que é destinada à utilização na prática clínica e na pesquisa em atenção primária e em psiquiatria, e pode ser utilizada por clínicos após um treinamento rápido (de 1 a 3 horas). A versão Plus do MINI, mais detalhada, gera diagnósticos positivos dos principais transtornos psicóticos e do humor do DSM-IV. Este artigo apresenta os resultados de quatro estudos de validação do instrumento, realizados na Europa e nos EUA. Métodos: Os estudos 1 (França) e 2 (EUA) testaram a confiabilidade {\textless}FONT FACE="Symbol"{\textgreater}-{\textless}/FONT{\textgreater}entre avaliadores e teste-reteste {\textless}FONT FACE="Symbol"{\textgreater}-{\textless}/FONT{\textgreater}da versão DSM-III-R do MINI (n=84, sendo 42 pacientes psiquiátricos de cada centro) e sua validade com relação ao CIDI (n=346, sendo 296 pacientes psiquiátricos e 50 controles) e ao SCID-P (n=370, sendo 308 pacientes psiquiátricos e 62 controles), respectivamente. O estudo 3 testou a validade de diagnósticos gerados por clínicos gerais usando o MINI (DSM-IV) com relação aos diagnósticos clínicos habituais de psiquiatras, em 409 pacientes de centros de atenção primária de quatro países (França, Espanha, Itália e Reino Unido). O estudo 4 testou a confiabilidade entre avaliadores (n=20 pacientes psiquiátricos) e a validade dos módulos Transtornos Psicóticos, Depressão e Mania do MINI Plus - DSM IV (n=104 pacientes psiquiátricos) com relação a dois critérios de referência: diagnósticos do CIDI e diagnósticos clínicos de psiquiatras. Análises quantitativas (índices de concordância e de validade) e qualitativas (razões de discordância) foram realizadas. Resultados: Os índices de confiabilidade do MINI (estudos 1 e 2) e do MINI Plus (estudo 4) foram globalmente satisfatórios. Comparados a vários critérios de referência (CIDI, SCID-P, opinião de peritos), em diferentes contextos (unidades psiquiátricas e centros de atenção primária), o MINI e o MINI Plus mostraram qualidades psicométricas similares às de outras entrevistas diagnósticas padronizadas mais complexas, permitindo uma redução de 50\% ou mais no tempo da avaliação. Análises qualitativas identificaram dificuldades e erros diagnósticos ligados aos casos, métodos de avaliação e critérios de diagnósticos estudados. Modificações foram introduzidas para corrigir os problemas identificados e otimizar as propriedades psicométricas do MINI e do MINI Plus. Conclusões: O MINI e sua versão Plus são adaptados ao contexto clínico e à avaliação de pacientes mais graves, e representam uma alternativa econômica para a seleção de pacientes, segundo critérios internacionais, em estudos clínicos e epidemiológicos. O MINI já está disponível em aproximadamente 30 idiomas, incluindo a versão brasileira. As perspectivas atuais de adaptação e aplicação transcultural do instrumento são discutidas.
          , 
            Objectives: The MINI is a short (15-30 minutes) structured diagnostic interview compatible with DSM-III-R/IV and ICD-10 criteria. It was designed for the clinical practice and research in psychiatric and primary care settings. Clinicians learn how to use it after a short training (1-3 hours). The MINI Plus is a more detailed version that helps mainly with the diagnosis of Psychotic and Mood DSM-IV Disorders. Here are presented the results of 4 MINI validation studies conducted in Europe and the U.S. Methods: The studies 1 (France) and 2 (U.S.) tested the DSM-III-R MINI reliability (inter-rater and test-retest; n=84, 42 psychiatric patients from each center) and its validity comparing with the CIDI (n=346, 296 psychiatric patients and 50 controls) and the SCID-P (n=370, 308 psychiatric patients and 62 controls), respectively. The study 3 tested the validity of general practitioners' diagnoses using the MINI (DSM-IV) compared with expert psychiatrists' diagnoses for 409 patients of primary care centers in four countries (France, Spain, Italy and United Kingdom). The study 4 tested inter-rater reliability (n=20 psychiatric patients) and the Psychotic Disorders, Depression and Mania modules validity of the Mini Plus {\textless}FONT FACE="Symbol"{\textgreater}-{\textless}/FONT{\textgreater}DSM-IV (n=104 psychiatric patients) compared with two standard criteria: CIDI and expert psychiatrists' diagnoses. Quantitative (indexes of agreement and validity) and qualitative (sources of discrepancies) analyses were performed. Results: The MINI (studies 1 e 2) and MINI Plus (study 4) reliability were overall satisfactory. Compared to various diagnostic standard criteria (CIDI, SCID-P, expert opinion) in different settings (psychiatric and primary care centers), MINI and the MINI Plus showed the same psychometric properties seen in more complex structured diagnostic interviews, reducing in more than 50\% the assessment time. Qualitative analyses identified diagnostic difficulties and bias related to cases, assessment methods and diagnostic criteria. Modifications were introduced to correct any identified problem and improve the psychometric properties of the MINI/MINI Plus. Conclusions: MINI and its Plus version are adjusted to the clinical setting and for the assessment of severe cases. They represent an economic alternative for selecting patients, according to international criteria, in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. The MINI DSM-IV 5.0 is available in almost 30 languages, including a Brazilian version. Current perspectives of the interview cross-cultural adjustments and application are discussed.},

              Background:
              Sleep alterations are frequent occurrence in Bipolar Disorder (BD), both in acute and interepisodic phases. Sleep alterations have been also described both long before BD onset, as aspecific risk syndromes, or as immediate prodromes of BD onset. The aim of the present study is to systematically review the relationship between sleep alterations anticipating for the full-blown onset of BD, both in general and according to specific polarities of onset.
            
            
              Methods:
              A systematic literature research according to PRISMA statement and considering: 1. prospective studies about BD patients’ offspring with sleep alterations who later developed BD. 2. prospective studies assessing patients with sleep disorders who later developed BD. 3. retrospective studies on BD patients where sleep alterations before BD onset of the disease were reported.
            
            
              Results:
              A total of 16 studies were included in this review. Sleep disturbances may frequently appear 1 year before the onset of BD or more, often during childhood or adolescence. A decreased need for sleep may precede the onset of the illness, specially a manic episode, while insomnia appears to anticipate either a manic or a depressive episode. Hypersomnia seems to precede bipolar depressive episodes.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Sleep alterations frequently appear long before the onset of BD, and appear to be related specifically to the polarity of the index episode. The detection and treatment of sleep alterations in special high risk populations may help achieving an earlier detection of the illness.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              Disruptions in biological rhythms and sleep are a core aspect of mood disorders, with sleep and rhythm changes frequently occurring prior to and during mood episodes. Wrist-worn actigraphs are increasingly utilized to measure ambulatory activity rhythm and sleep patterns.
            
            
              Methods:
              A comprehensive study using subjective and objective measures of sleep and biological rhythms was conducted in 111 participants (40 healthy volunteers [HC], 38 with major depressive disorder [MDD] and 33 with bipolar disorder [BD]). Participants completed 15-day actigraphy and first-morning urine samples to measure 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. Sleep and biological rhythm questionnaires were administered: Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN), Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Actigraph data were analyzed for sleep and daily activity rhythms, light exposure and likelihood of transitioning between rest and activity states.
            
            
              Results:
              Mood groups had worse subjective sleep quality (PSQI) and biological rhythm disruption (BRIAN) and higher objective mean nighttime activity than controls. Participants with BD had longer total sleep time, higher circadian quotient and lower 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels than HC group. The MDD group had longer sleep onset latency and higher daytime probability of transitioning from rest to activity than HCs. Mood groups displayed later mean timing of light exposure. Multiple linear regression analysis with BRIAN scores, circadian quotient, mean nighttime activity during rest and daytime probability of transitioning from activity to rest explained 43\% of variance in quality-of-life scores. BRIAN scores, total sleep time and probability of transitioning from activity to rest explained 52\% of variance in functioning (all p {\textless} 0.05).
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Disruption in biological rhythms is associated with poorer functioning and quality of life in bipolar and MDD. Investigating biological rhythms and sleep using actigraphy variables, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and subjective measures provide evidence of widespread sleep and circadian system disruptions in mood disorders.},

              Subjective reports of insomnia and hypersomnia are common in bipolar disorder (BD). It is unclear to what extent these relate to underlying circadian rhythm disturbance (CRD). In this study we aimed to objectively assess sleep and circadian rhythm in a cohort of patients with BD compared to matched controls.
            
            
              Method
              Forty-six patients with BD and 42 controls had comprehensive sleep/circadian rhythm assessment with respiratory sleep studies, prolonged accelerometry over 3 weeks, sleep questionnaires and diaries, melatonin levels, alongside mood, psychosocial functioning and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires.
            
            
              Results
              Twenty-three (50\%) patients with BD had abnormal sleep, of whom 12 (52\%) had CRD and 29\% had obstructive sleep apnoea. Patients with abnormal sleep had lower 24-h melatonin secretion compared to controls and patients with normal sleep. Abnormal sleep/CRD in BD was associated with impaired functioning and worse QoL.
            
            
              Conclusions
              BD is associated with high rates of abnormal sleep and CRD. The association between these disorders, mood and functioning, and the direction of causality, warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Objective:
              Bipolar disorders (BD) are characterized by sleep disturbances and emotional dysregulation both during acute episodes and remission periods. We hypothesized that sleep quality (SQ) and emotional reactivity (ER) defined clusters of patients with no or abnormal SQ and ER and we studied the association with functioning.
            
            
              Method:
              We performed a bi-dimensional cluster analysis using SQ and ER measures in a sample of 533 outpatients patients with BD (in remission or with subsyndromal mood symptoms). Clusters were compared for mood symptoms, sleep profile and functioning.
            
            
              Results:
              We identified three clusters of patients: C1 (normal ER and SQ, 54\%), C2 (hypo-ER and low SQ, 22\%) and C3 (hyper-ER and low SQ, 24\%). C1 was characterized by minimal mood symptoms, better sleep profile and higher functioning than other clusters. Although highly different for ER, C2 and C3 had similar levels of subsyndromal mood symptoms as assessed using classical mood scales. When exploring sleep domains, C2 showed poor sleep efficiency and a trend for longer sleep latency as compared to C3. Interestingly, alterations in functioning were similar in C2 and C3, with no difference in any of the sub-domains.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Abnormalities in ER and SQ delineated three clusters of patients with BD and significantly impacted on functioning.},

              To verify the prevalence and clinical impact of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in outpatients with bipolar disorder.
            
            
              Methods
              Eighty‐one outpatients with bipolar disorder and 79 healthy control subjects were recruited. Patients were required not to be acutely manic or depressed. We used the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Functioning Assessment Short Test to assess sleepiness, sleep problems and functioning, respectively.
            
            
              Results
              Patients had a higher prevalence of sleepiness (40\%) than the control group (18\%). Sleepiness and sleep disturbance had independent impacts on disability in the multivariable model.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study suggests that EDS is a relevant clinical dimension in patients with bipolar disorder. It is a frequent symptom that often overlaps with other sleep disturbances. This study also reveals that once present it has the potential to increase functional impairment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the role of perceived sleep quality in predicting subjective as well as objective cognitive function in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD).
METHODS: Adults with recurrent MDD (n = 100) experiencing a major depressive episode of at least moderate severity and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC) (n = 100) were recruited to participate in a clinical trial validating the THINC-integrated tool (THINC-it; NCT02508493) for cognitive function. The THINC-it includes subjective and objective measures of cognitive function. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
RESULTS: Compared with HC, individuals with MDD reported significantly poorer sleep quality, as assessed by domain and global PSQI scores (all P values {\textless}.05). Both perceived sleep quality (P {\textless} .001) and depression severity (P = .002) were found to independently predict impairments in subjective cognitive performance. Only perceived sleep quality predicted objective cognitive impairments (P = .017). Exploratory mediation analysis revealed depression severity to be a partial mediator of the relationship between perceived sleep quality and subjective cognitive performance (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.56, -0.33).
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the subjective and objective cognitive impairments are differentially related to perceived sleep quality and depression severity and emphasize the importance of treating sleep disturbances in MDD.},

              Background.
              Distinguishing prodromes of bipolar disorder (BD) specific to children/adolescents, adults, and elderly patients is essential. The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine initial and relapse prodromes identifying adult patients with BD.
            
            
              Methods.
              PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched using a predetermined strategy. A controlled process of study selection and data extraction was performed.
            
            
              Results.
              The 22 articles selected included 1,809 adult patients with BD. Initial prodromes cited most frequently in these studies showed low specificity. Among relapse prodromes cited most frequently, more talkative than usual, increased energy/more goal-directed behavior, thoughts start to race, increased self-esteem, strong interest in sex, increase in activity, and spending too much were identified exclusively before a manic/hypomanic episode, while loss of interest and hypersomnia were detected only before a depressive episode. Initial prodromal phases lasted longer than prodromal relapse phases. In the selected studies, the most used prodrome identification procedure was the clinical interview.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              For adult patients with BD, initial and relapse prodromes of manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes were identified. It is proposed that the most frequent prodromes found in this review be incorporated into a smartphone app that monitors the functioning of people at risk of BD and patients who have already been diagnosed. Data from this app would constitute a relevant source of big data.},

	abstract = {The majority of individuals with depression experience sleep disturbances. Depression is also over-represented among populations with a variety of sleep disorders. Although sleep disturbances are typical features of depression, such symptoms sometimes appear prior to an episode of depression. The bidirectional associations between sleep disturbance (especially insomnia) and depression increase the difficulty of differentiating cause-and-effect relationships between them. Longitudinal studies have consistently identified insomnia as a risk factor for the development of a new-onset or recurrent depression, and this association has been identified in young, middle-aged, and older adults. Studies have also observed that the combination of insomnia and depression influences the trajectory of depression, increasing episode severity and duration as well as relapse rates. Fortunately, recent studies have demonstrated that both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for insomnia may favorably reduce and possibly prevent depression. Together, these findings suggest that sleep-related symptoms that are present before, during, andlor after a depressive episode are potentially modifiable factors that may play an important role in achieving and maintaining depression remission.},

	abstract = {Background.
              Though poorly defined, hypersomnia is associated with negative health outcomes and new-onset and recurrence of psychiatric illness. Lack of definition impedes generalizability across studies. The present research clarifies hypersomnia diagnoses in bipolar disorder by exploring possible subgroups and their relationship to prospective sleep data and relapse into mood episodes.
            
            
              Method.
              A community sample of 159 adults (aged 18–70 years) with bipolar spectrum diagnoses, euthymic at study entry, was included. Self-report inventories and clinician-administered interviews determined features of hypersomnia. Participants completed sleep diaries and wore wrist actigraphs at home to obtain prospective sleep data. Approximately 7 months later, psychiatric status was reassessed. Factor analysis and latent profile analysis explored empirical groupings within hypersomnia diagnoses.
            
            
              Results.
              Factor analyses confirmed two separate subtypes of hypersomnia (‘long sleep’ and ‘excessive sleepiness’) that were uncorrelated. Latent profile analyses suggested a four-class solution, with ‘long sleep’ and ‘excessive sleepiness’ again representing two separate classes. Prospective sleep data suggested that the sleep of ‘long sleepers’ is characterized by a long time in bed, not long sleep duration. Longitudinal assessment suggested that ‘excessive sleepiness’ at baseline predicted mania/hypomania relapse.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              This study is the largest of hypersomnia to include objective sleep measurement, and refines our understanding of classification, characterization and associated morbidity. Hypersomnia appears to be comprised of two separate subgroups: long sleep and excessive sleepiness. Long sleep is characterized primarily by long bedrest duration. Excessive sleepiness is not associated with longer sleep or bedrest, but predicts relapse to mania/hypomania. Understanding these entities has important research and treatment implications.},
